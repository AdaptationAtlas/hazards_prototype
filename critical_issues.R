# Hazards ####
# Update mapspam to USD 2017
# Update NTx35 and NTx40 to NTxCROP with a crop specific threshold
# Use crop specific GGCMI Phase 3 crop calendars
# Integrate moderate, severe and extreme hazards into a single process (64 combinations)

# ROI ####
# Scale mapspam 2005 production to 2017 production?
# Add human population adoption rates (would also need to integrate with farming system)
# Add farming systems (I think this would require extraction of value by farming system and administrative area)
# Herrero data download needs to be added, add data to S3
