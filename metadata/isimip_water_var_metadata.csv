evap,Evapotranspiration,Evapotranspiration: The total water loss due to evaporation and plant transpiration.,Sum,"Evapotranspiration represents the total water loss due to evaporation and plant transpiration. Summing it over the growing season gives the total water loss, which is critical for understanding water balance.",kg m-2 s-1
qg,Groundwater Recharge,Groundwater Recharge: The amount of water that infiltrates into the groundwater system.,Sum,"Groundwater recharge is the amount of water that infiltrates into the groundwater system. Summing it over the growing season provides the total recharge, which is important for assessing groundwater resources.",kg m-2 s-1
qr,Surface Runoff,Surface Runoff: The portion of precipitation that flows over the land surface.,Sum,"Surface runoff is the portion of precipitation that flows over the land surface. Summing it over the growing season gives the total runoff, which is important for understanding flood risks and water availability.","kg m-2 s-1 "
qs,Subsurface Runoff,Subsurface Runoff: The portion of water that flows underground but near the surface.,Sum,"Subsurface runoff is the portion of water that flows underground but near the surface. Summing it over the growing season provides the total subsurface runoff, which contributes to streamflow and groundwater recharge.","kg m-2 s-1 "
qtot,Total Runoff,Total Runoff: The combination of surface and subsurface runoff.,Sum,"Total runoff combines surface and subsurface runoff. Summing it over the growing season provides the total runoff, which is essential for water resource management.",kg m-2 s-1
groundwstor,Groundwater Storage,Groundwater Storage: The amount of water stored in the groundwater system.,Mean,"Groundwater storage represents the amount of water stored in the groundwater system. Averaging it over the growing season provides a representative value of groundwater availability, as storage values fluctuate less rapidly than fluxes.",kg m-2
dis,Discharge,Discharge: The flow of water in rivers or streams.,Mean,"Discharge is the flow of water in rivers or streams. Averaging it over the growing season gives a representative flow rate, which is important for water management.",m3 s-1
