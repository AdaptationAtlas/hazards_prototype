# DISPATCH — pascal — #58 (#29 follow-ups) phase A: R environment audit + MapSPAM re-fetch

**Append-only; newest block on top. Prepend `### RESPONSE — pascal` to answer.**

### MACBOOK 2026-11-02 — P0-P2: R audit (read-only), re-fetch `mapspam-2020v1r2` (the one fix). **Small profile is fine.**

**Why.** Issue [#58](https://github.com/AdaptationAtlas/hazards_prototype/issues/58) tracks the seven #29
follow-ups.
- **Phases B and C need a working R stack.** Phase B runs R/0.4.1 here for a value-level cross-host gate. Phase C runs
  one GCM through `hazards_upstream` 01→04. Since the 4.5.1 → 4.6.1 upgrade, `data.table` and `rlang` fail to load
  here. P1 measures how much of the stack those two phases need is broken, which sizes the IT ask and the per-user
  rebuild fallback.
- **The MapSPAM fix.** On 2026-10-09 your processed MapSPAM tree held 36 files against the 48 the origin holds, and
  two of them were truncated. `R/00_acquire.R` now pins a per-object manifest
  (`metadata/catalogue/_manifests/mapspam-2020v1r2.tsv`: size plus S3 ETag), writes each download through a `.part`
  file and hashes it. It also reads S3 over plain HTTPS in base R, so it no longer needs `s3fs`, which this node does
  not have. P2 is the first run of that code on a node.

**Rules.**
- **Install nothing.** No `install.packages`, no `pacman`, and do **not** source `R/0_server_setup.R`: its
  `pacman::p_load()` installs whatever is missing.
- **Writes go only to:**
  - the MapSPAM processed tree (`<working_dir>/Data/mapspam/2020V1r2_SSA/processed`);
  - its receipt (`<working_dir>/Data/_acquisition/mapspam-2020v1r2.jsonl`);
  - `logs/`.
- No S3 writes (none are possible here).
- **Background jobs** use `nohup … &` with `logs/<name>_<STAMP>.log` plus a `.pid` file. Track them by polling
  `kill -0 $(cat <pid>)` or the log tail, not with `wait`.
- **Shell variables.** If your shell does not keep variables between commands, start each one with
  `cd <repo> && export ATLAS_PROJECT_DIR=$PWD`, and re-derive `MS` (P2.1) where it is used.
- **Public repo.** No usernames, hostnames, IPs or mount identifiers in the RESPONSE. Write paths as `<repo>`,
  `<working_dir>` and `~`.

#### P0 — pull, identity, limits (this is item (c))
```bash
cd <repo> && export ATLAS_PROJECT_DIR=$PWD
git fetch && git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD          # must be: develop
git pull --ff-only && git log --oneline -1            # at or after the commit that added this file
CG=/sys/fs/cgroup$(cut -d: -f3 /proc/self/cgroup); cat $CG/cpu.max $CG/memory.max
R --version | head -1; Rscript -e 'cat(.libPaths(), sep = "\n")' | sed "s#$HOME#~#"
```
**Stop and report** if the branch is not `develop`. Do not switch branches yourself.

#### P1 — (a) R environment audit (read-only, a few minutes)
`R/checks/76_r_env_audit.R` statically scans R/0.4.x, together with what they need sourced first and
`hazards_upstream/R/**`, for `library`, `require`, `requireNamespace`, `p_load` and `pkg::`. That gives 70
packages. It then loads each one in its own fresh `Rscript` and reports OK, BROKEN or MISSING, the version, and the
library it came from (user / site / base). It installs nothing.
```bash
STAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
nohup Rscript R/checks/76_r_env_audit.R --out logs/r_env_audit_$STAMP.tsv > logs/r_env_audit_$STAMP.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > logs/r_env_audit_$STAMP.pid
# poll: kill -0 $(cat logs/r_env_audit_$STAMP.pid) 2>/dev/null && echo running || tail -6 logs/r_env_audit_$STAMP.log
```
**What to expect** (invariants, not exact counts):
- `data.table` is OK from `user` (1.18.6.1);
- `rlang`-dependent packages (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, `purrr`, …) are BROKEN with `SETLENGTH`;
- `terra` and `sf` are OK;
- `s3fs` and `paws.storage` are MISSING (already known).

Some `upstream` rows come from `hazards_upstream` scripts outside 01→04 (climate4R and similar). The `used_by` column
shows which.

**Report:**
- the summary lines verbatim (`OK / BROKEN / MISSING`, plus the per-scope lines `0.4-chain` / `both` /
  `upstream`);
- the whole TSV in a fenced block;
- one line on whether any BROKEN error is something **other** than `SETLENGTH`.

#### P2 — (b) re-fetch `mapspam-2020v1r2` (the one fix)
**Gate:** `jsonlite` must be OK in the P1 table, because the acquire layer reads the catalogue with it. If it is
BROKEN or MISSING, stop here and do not install it.

**P2.1 before (read-only; hashes about 1.3 GB):**
```bash
STAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
nohup Rscript R/checks/75_catalogue_manifest.R --verify mapspam-2020v1r2 --hash > logs/mapspam_verify_before_$STAMP.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > logs/mapspam_verify_before_$STAMP.pid
MS=$(Rscript -e 'source("R/00_paths.R"); cat(file.path(atlas_working_dir(), "Data/mapspam/2020V1r2_SSA/processed"))')
for f in rf-all rf-highinput; do p="$MS/variable=phys-area_ha/spam_phys-area_ha_$f.tif"; echo "$f $(stat -c %s "$p" 2>/dev/null) $(md5sum "$p" 2>/dev/null | cut -d' ' -f1)"; done
```
These ETags are multipart (`<md5>-<parts>`), so a plain md5 of the file will **not** equal them. The verifier
recomputes the multipart form; the plain md5s are reported for the record.

**Reference** (S3 listing 2026-11-02; the macbook copy hash-verifies against it, 48/48):

| tile | bytes | S3 ETag | plain md5 of a good copy (macbook) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spam_phys-area_ha_rf-all.tif` | 47,197,123 | `851e2ea5dc5b7cb19f6303cd9e05400d-6` | `3807675ba25f455ffaa4d8f3d84e58f8` |
| `spam_phys-area_ha_rf-highinput.tif` | 25,830,038 | `f2e4ecb28b9e774e2c8507f836d62bda-4` | `e5cc9a45b20fb9e45e60080558a7fa6b` |

**P2.2 fetch** (`force = TRUE`, scoped to this one record, about 1.33 GB over HTTPS). The macbook gets about 1.3 MB/s
from this bucket, so allow **20-60 min**:
```bash
STAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
nohup Rscript -e 'source("R/00_paths.R"); source("R/00_acquire.R"); atlas_acquire("mapspam-2020v1r2", force = TRUE)' \
  > logs/mapspam_refetch_$STAMP.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > logs/mapspam_refetch_$STAMP.pid
# poll: kill -0 $(cat logs/mapspam_refetch_$STAMP.pid) 2>/dev/null && echo running || tail -6 logs/mapspam_refetch_$STAMP.log
```
**What to expect:**
- the log shows `pinned manifest: 48 object(s), 1,332,962,700 bytes`;
- it ends `48 object(s): 48 fetched (N re-fetched)`, where N = files that already existed;
- the closing line reads `verified: hash 48, size only 0, drift 0, no manifest 0`;
- no `verification failed` anywhere.

Give the wall time and the effective MB/s, since this is the S3-over-HTTPS rate for this node.

**P2.3 after:**
```bash
Rscript R/checks/75_catalogue_manifest.R --verify mapspam-2020v1r2 --hash > logs/mapspam_verify_after_$STAMP.log 2>&1; tail -4 logs/mapspam_verify_after_$STAMP.log
for f in rf-all rf-highinput; do p="$MS/variable=phys-area_ha/spam_phys-area_ha_$f.tif"; echo "$f $(stat -c %s "$p") $(md5sum "$p" | cut -d' ' -f1)"; done
find "$MS" -name '*.part' | wc -l       # expect 0
Rscript -e 'source("R/00_paths.R"); source("R/00_acquire.R"); s <- atlas_acquire_status("mapspam-2020v1r2"); print(tail(s[, c("timestamp","method","files","bytes","status")], 2), row.names = FALSE)'
```
**What to expect:**
- `PASS`, with `ok=48`;
- the two tiles at the reference sizes and plain md5s above;
- zero `.part` files;
- the last receipt row `ok`.

Any `extra` rows are local files the origin does not hold. They are expected, not a failure: R/0.4.0 and R/0.4.2 write
`variable=vop_intld15-2021/` and `fao_prices/` into this tree. List the extras by top-level directory with a count for
each, and **do not delete them**.

**Report:**
- the P2.1 summary line (`ok=… missing=… size=… hash=… extra=…`) and every non-`ok` row;
- the two tiles' before/after size and md5, each set against the reference;
- the P2.2 tail and its rate;
- the P2.3 lines.

**Stop and describe** (do not improvise a fix) on any of:
- not on `develop`;
- `jsonlite` not OK;
- `verification failed` in P2.2;
- P2.3 not `PASS` (other than extras);
- anything written outside the three places listed under Rules.

**To answer:**
1. Prepend one `### RESPONSE — pascal` (P0-P2) to this file.
2. Run the `AGENTS.md` §3 IP grep, and check by eye that the RESPONSE holds no usernames or hostnames.
3. Commit only this file, then push.
4. Verify it landed: `git fetch`, then `git log origin/develop..HEAD` must be empty.
5. End with a delivery line.

Keep the logs.
